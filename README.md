# 学习ggplot2的素材
## viz-pub

This is my ([halhen](https://www.reddit.com/user/halhen/) / [@hnrklndbrg](https://twitter.com/hnrklndbrg)) place to publish data visualizations. Besides publishing code and work-in-progress images, I also use this to host my final visualizations. I wrote the back-story and reasons for why in a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@halhen/lessons-learned-from-putting-an-erroneous-visualization-on-reddits-front-page-998bc3c62116).

Due to copyright, I will not publish the original data. Instead, comments link to the source I used when downloading the source, if applicable. If I have to aggregate or extract data from e.g. PDF:s, I may add data files to each project.

Each visualization is in a directory, generally with the following components:

* An R-file to generate a base plot
* An SVG-file which is the Inkscape-modified output of the base plot
* The final image for publication

The SVG:s are plain Inkscape dittos. It seems that Inkscape's implementation of SVG differs from others. Several people have reported errors when opening these SVGs in e.g. Firefox. I consider them only to be Inkscape raw files there for you to be able to fiddle yourself, not as published end results.
